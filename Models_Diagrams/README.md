Models Sample
==============

Instructions
------------

Please include a sample model in this folder. 

A model from one of your personal projects is preferred, though anything that demonstrates your ability with one of the following types of programs is acceptable:

* SolidWorks
* FreeCAD
* Sketchup
* Blender
* Fritzing
* Illustrator
* Inkscape

Additional points
------------------

* The model does not need to be overly complex, if creating one from scratch.
* This must be your original work. Any partial contributions from others should be attributed.
